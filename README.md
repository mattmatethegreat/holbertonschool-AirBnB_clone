README:

This is the Readme documentation for my Holberton Airbnb project.
this repository will be used for a Command Interpreter designed to 
work similarly to Airbnb. it will be an interactive menu capable 
operating in both interactive as well as non interactive modes.

Functionality:

* Create new objects: New User or New Place>
* Retrieve objects from a file, database etc.
* Handle operations on object: count, compute, etc.
* Update attributes for objects.
* Destroy objects.

User Guide:

To enter the console in interactive user will enter: ./console.py
this will take you into the commmand prompt.

User Input Key (Interactive):

1: help - displays list of commands and other info.
2: quit - this allows you to exit the terminal.

Non Interactive User Guide:

Example: echo "help" | ./console.py

will display help screen from terminal listing all information.
